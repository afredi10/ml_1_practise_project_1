        <p>A few years ago, I didn’t really had the urge to travel, but 4 days ago, I came back from my first overseas adventure and this changed my life.
        It all started 5 months ago, when I applied together with my significant other to participate in the 19th World Festival of Youth & Students in Sochi, Russia. We were both selected and invited to represent our country at this festival!
        I was really happy about this good news, because after a few rejections of other applications, I was finally selected! So at this point, we started with the preparations, because we didn’t want to miss this once in a lifetime opportunity. We wrote sponsorship letters, articles and had appointments with the government.</p>
